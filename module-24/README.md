# What is Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript Applications

### Predictable

- Single source of truth
- Immutable Behavior
- Usage of Pure Function
- Object as Action
- Unidirectional flow

### Centralize

- Centralize State

### Debuggable

- Gives a Dev-tool

### Flexible

- Independent UI Framework
- Middleware Support

# Inner workings of Redux

### Terminology

- **Action:** Action taken by user. Each action has a corresponding reducer function
- **Dispatch:** Sending the action object to the store. Dispatching an action triggers the corresponding reducer to update the state
- **Payload:** Optional data that is attached to an action. It carries any additional information that needs to be sent along with the action to update the state
- **Reducer:** A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as inputs and returns a new state. It defines how the applicationâ€™s state changes in response to different actions
- **Store:** The store holds the state of the application. The store is responsible for dispatching actions, maintaining the state, and notifying subscribers about state changes
